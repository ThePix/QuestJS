/*
The ship is on a long mission to visit various stars to survey them. It takes years between each one, so the crew are in stasis. The shop has an AI that controls the ship between stars, and on arrival does the initial scans, looking for anything interesting. The ship does not have the capability to land (it has two escape pods that can be used to land, but not get off the planet again).

There are:
Six stasis pods
Five? crew
Six seeder pods, to be deployed in batches of three
Six satellites
Sixteen probes with crawler-bots
Six probes with marine-bots
Two escape pods

Probes:
Geology (MS, also analyse atmosphere)
Biology (slice and dice, microscope)

Keep a score in the way of a bonus, related to how much data for useful planets

Each awakening gets steadily worse, by the fourth you are throwing up.
